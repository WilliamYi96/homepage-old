                              At present, the performance of deep neural network in general object detection is comparable to or even surpasses that of human beings. However, due to the limitations of deep learning itself, the small proportion of feature pixels, and the occurence of blur and occlusion, the detection of small objects in complex scenes is still an open question. But we can not deny that real-time and accurate object detection is fundamental to automatic perception and subsequent perception-based decision-making and planning tasks of autonomous driving.
  
                        <br>
                        Considering the characteristics of small objects in autonomous driving scene, we proposed a novel method named KB-RANN, which based on domain knowledge, intuitive experience and feature attentive selection. It can focus on particular parts of image features, and then it tries to stress the importance  of  these features and strengthenes the learning parameters of them. Our comparative experiments on KITTI and COCO datasets show that our proposed method can achieve considerable results both in speed and accuracy, and can improve the effect of small object detection through self-selection of important features and continuous enhancement of features. In addition,  we  transfer the KITTI trained model directly to the  BTSD  dataset,  and  find that KB-RANN has a good knowledge transfer ability. What’s more, we have successfully compressed and accelerated our proposed method, and deployed it in our self-developed autonomous driving car.

                        LBG algorithm is a simple and effective method to train codebook for vector quantization. After LBG was proposed, several interesting algorithms were published to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of LBG. Unlike vector quantization, univariate linear approximation is another important data compression method, which approximates a target vector by a linear transformation of a selected codeword from codebook. Many applications also use LBG or K-means algorithm to train the codebook for univariate linear approximation. In this paper, we proposed an improved LBG algorithm called the affine LBG algorithm to train the codebook for univariate linear approximation. The experimental results show that the affine LBG algorithm can derive a more effective codebook than LBG algorithm for univariate linear approximation. Moreover, the ALBG algorithm is more efficient than LBG algorithm.

                            The human brain is composed of multiple modular subsystems, with a unique way interacting among each other. These subsystems have their own unique characteristics and interact to support cognitive functions such as memory, attention and cognitive control. Nowadays, deep learning methods based on the above-mentioned functions accompanied with knowledge are widely used to design more dynamic, robust and powerful systems. We first review and summarize the progresses of cognition-based deep neural networks, and how cognitive mechanisms can be applied to more brain-like neural networks. Then we propose a general framework for the design of cognition-based deep learning system. Although great efforts have been made in this field, cognition-based deep learning is still in its early age. We put forward the potential directions towards this field, such as associative memory in deep learning, interpretable network with cognitive mechanisms, and deep reinforcement learning based on cognitive science.

In this paper, we proposed a novel hierarchical conceptual rotation theory to explain the knowledge representation of mental. We maintain the perception and the procedure of similarity-matching is motivated by a hierarchical manner. Two key roles are hierarchical representation of knowledge and conceptual rotation. The former is composed of four different levels, with the perception procedure goes further, the degree of abstraction goes deeper. Besides, the latter consists of three stages, they are the manipulations of visual
mental imagery. Experiment is specially designed to prove the widely accepted phenomenon of hierarchical structure also exists in the process of mental imagery. Further, the discover of hierarchical mental imagery may help a lot to the further study of the procedure of learning and perception of we human. What’s more, as this structure shows highly similarity with the procedure of human cognition, the proposed novel framework of the manipulation of perception may help to build more human-alike and dynamic artificial intelligence systems.

Due to the fact that this paper is exactly the solution of the open question from Professor Hayes’ homepage, after reviewing those mentioned above, we will mainly talk about the design principle, fundamental ideas and experiments of the task. In order to show our results more friendly, I visualized them by using Python and Mathematica respectively.

Our project aims at alleviating the problem of loneliness in the elderly by providing efficient methods such as quering and reminding functions through personalized speech synthesis. Research experiments have shown that the intended audience has a generally positive attitude toward our products, and it is believed that the function of the product contributes to the relief of loneliness. We
                            intend to promote the product in the form of an APP in the early stage. We will consider contacting hardware manufacturers in the later period and provide this service to specialized embedded devices such as bracelet.

                            This paper is divided into several different parts as follows. The first part first explained the basis of the project and its implementation background, and explained the universality of loneliness, the urgency of resolving the problem of loneliness in the elderly. Further, we will illustrate the acceptability and generalizability of our product through detailed literature data and field research reports. The second part of the next section analyzes the essential techniques and model architecture of the project, highlighting the technical features of several different modules such as product speaker recognition, factor modeling, strong voice interaction, and the proposed solution. The third part, as a separate chapter, emphasizes the issues related to server design and development. After fully investigating the current implementation of database engineering, it carefully analyzes the different stages of server design and implementation, and applies this concept to the process. Instruct the server to build and maintain the entire stage. In the fourth part, the
                            output of the project acceptance node is explained from two different perspectives: scientific research achievement and engineering achievement. Among them, the team members are the core, and around the technical key points and difficulties of the project. The project has successfully built and deployed on the server, and completed the first phase of Android application development. Due to the fact that the project is problem oriented towards commercial applications, we have carefully and rigorously applied to various aspects of commercialization such as marketing, personnel management, and risk control. What’s more, we will analyse the high demand, scalability, and profitability of the project.

                        In order to find good patterns in the field of associative memory, we conduct feature extraction by using SIFT and BoF. Further research will classify objects based on HODHNN (High-Order Discrete Hopfield Neural Network) by utilizing the extracted features.

                        A large number of fields (e.g. natural language processing, computer vision) have
                            witnessed the power of deep convolutional neural networks(CNN). However, both
                            training and doing inference are computationally expensive and memory intensive.
                            Therefore, a growing number of researches are attempting to compress convolutional neural networks, which aimed at accelerating CNN-based models without
                            losing accuracy. These techniques are roughly categorized into four schemes: neural network configuration reset, parameter pruning and sharing, low-rank factorization and sparsity, and knowledge distillation. For methods of each scheme, we
                            provide a roughly insightful analysis regarding their performance, related applications, advantages and drawbacks. After that, we survey the evaluation benchmarks
                            and datasets. Finally, we conclude this paper, discuss remaining challenges and
                            our opinions about the direction in this topic.
