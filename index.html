                            The human brain is composed of multiple modular subsystems, with a unique way interacting among each other. These subsystems have their own unique characteristics and interact to support cognitive functions such as memory, attention and cognitive control. Nowadays, deep learning methods based on the above-mentioned functions accompanied with knowledge are widely used to design more dynamic, robust and powerful systems. We first review and summarize the progresses of cognition-based deep neural networks, and how cognitive mechanisms can be applied to more brain-like neural networks. Then we propose a general framework for the design of cognition-based deep learning system. Although great efforts have been made in this field, cognition-based deep learning is still in its early age. We put forward the potential directions towards this field, such as associative memory in deep learning, interpretable network with cognitive mechanisms, and deep reinforcement learning based on cognitive science.

                            Accurate Traffic Sign Detection (TSD) can help intelligent systems make better decisions according to the traffic regulations. TSD, regarded as a typical small object detection problem in some way, is fundamental in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and self-driving. However, although deep neural networks have achieved human even superhuman performance on several tasks, due to their own limitations, small object detection is still an open question. In this paper, we proposed a brain-inspired network, named as KB-RANN, to handle this problem. Attention mechanism is an essential function of our brain, we used a novel recurrent attentive neural network to improve the detection accuracy in a fine-grained manner. Further, we combined domain specific knowledge and intuitive knowledge to improve the efficiency. Experimental result shows that our methods achieved better performance than several popular methods widely used in object detection. More significantly, we transplanted our method on our designed embedded system and deployed on our self-driving car successfully.

                        Security surveillance is one of the most important issues in smart cities, especially in an era
                        of
                        terrorism. Deploying a number of (video) cameras is a
                        common approach for surveillance information retrieval.
                        Given the never-ending power offered by vehicles to a
                        metropolis, exploiting vehicle traffic to design camera
                        placement strategies could potentially facilitate physicalworld security surveillance. We take
                        the first step towards
                        exploring the linkage between vehicle traffic and camera
                        placement in favor of physical-world security surveillance

                        This paper aims to extend the merits of residual network, such as skip
                        connection induced fast training, for a typical low-level vision problem,
                        i.e., single image super-resolution. In general, the two main challenges
                        of existing deep CNN for supper-resolution lie in the gradient exploding/vanishing
                        problem and large amount of parameters or computational
                        cost as CNN goes deeper. Correspondingly, the skip connections or identity
                        mapping shortcuts are utilized to avoid gradient exploding/vanishing
                        problem. To tackle with the second problem, a parameter economic CNN
                        architecture which has carefully designed width, depth and skip connections
                        was proposed. Different residual-like architectures for image superresolution
                        has also been compared. Experimental results have demonstrated
                        that the proposed CNN model can not only achieve state-of-the-art
                        PSNR and SSIM results for single image super-resolution but also produce
                        visually pleasant results.

In this paper, we proposed a novel hierarchical conceptual rotation theory to explain the knowledge representation of mental. We maintain the perception and the procedure of similarity-matching is motivated by a hierarchical manner. Two key roles are hierarchical representation of knowledge and conceptual rotation. The former is composed of four different levels, with the perception procedure goes further, the degree of abstraction goes deeper. Besides, the latter consists of three stages, they are the manipulations of visual
mental imagery. Experiment is specially designed to prove the widely accepted phenomenon of hierarchical structure also exists in the process of mental imagery. Further, the discover of hierarchical mental imagery may help a lot to the further study of the procedure of learning and perception of we human. What’s more, as this structure shows highly similarity with the procedure of human cognition, the proposed novel framework of the manipulation of perception may help to build more human-alike and dynamic artificial intelligence systems.

Graph theories are popular among a lot of fields. In this paper, we will review their usages on solving the problem of biological network alignment. Due to the fact that this paper is exactly the solution of the open question from Professor Hayes’ homepage, after reviewing those mentioned above, we will mainly talk about the design principle, fundamental ideas and experiments of the task. In order to show our results more friendly, I visualized them by using Python and Mathematica respectively.
